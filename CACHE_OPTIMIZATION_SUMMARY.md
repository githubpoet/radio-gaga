# Line-Cache Optimization Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added screen_cache to __init__
- Added `self.screen_cache: Dict[int, str] = {}` in `RadioTUI.__init__()` (line 47)
- This dictionary stores the cached content for each screen row

### 2. Replaced stdscr.clear() with per-row diffing
- Modified `draw_ui()` method to use per-row diffing instead of `stdscr.clear()`
- The new implementation:
  - Generates all screen content into a `new_lines` dictionary
  - Compares each row with cached content in `self.screen_cache`
  - Only calls `addstr()` when content differs
  - Updates `self.screen_cache` after drawing
  - Clears unused rows when they're no longer needed

### 3. Efficient screen updates
- Replaced `stdscr.refresh()` with `stdscr.noutrefresh()` + `curses.doupdate()`
- This provides more efficient screen updates as recommended

### 4. Header and status rows handling
- Header and status rows are redrawn unconditionally as specified
- This is acceptable since they're few lines with negligible cost

## Key Features

### Content Generation
- `_generate_screen_content()` method creates structured content for each row
- Content format: `"TYPE|text|color_attributes"`
- Handles different content types: HEADER, NORMAL, STREAM, STATUS

### Row Drawing
- `_draw_row()` method handles drawing individual rows based on content type
- Supports centered headers, left-aligned streams, status with time positioning
- Clears each row before drawing new content

### Performance Benefits
- Eliminates full-screen repaints on every update
- Only redraws changed rows, significantly reducing screen flicker
- Maintains ~5Hz refresh rate with minimal CPU impact
- Cached content prevents unnecessary screen operations

## Technical Details

### Cache Structure
- `screen_cache: Dict[int, str]` maps row numbers to content strings
- Content strings encode both text and formatting attributes
- Cache is automatically cleaned when rows are no longer used

### Thread Safety
- All drawing operations remain within the existing `self.lock` context
- Cache updates are atomic and consistent with screen state

## Compatibility
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Preserves original UI appearance and behavior
- Compatible with existing color schemes and layout
